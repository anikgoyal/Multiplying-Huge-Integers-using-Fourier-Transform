# Multiplying-Huge-Integers-using-Fourier-Transform
The traditional approaches to multiplication require O(n2) multiplication operations, where n is the number of digits. One way to do this more efficiently is by using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) so that the number of multiplications is reduced to O(nlogn).
